## Database

### Migrations with Alembic

We use SQLAlchemy for ORM and Alembic for database migrations:

- Models are defined in `app/models/`
- To create a new migration after model changes:
  ```
  alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
  ```
- To apply migrations:
  ```
  alembic upgrade head
  ```
- To downgrade to a previous migration:
  ```
  alembic downgrade -1  # or specific revision ID
  ```
